Meeting-01: 11.04.2022, 20:05 - 20:55

Test-01: Testing and controability of motor drivers from arduino. Partial success in rotating motors due to absence of stable-voltage power supply. Successful testing to potential difference reversals at the output ports.


Meeting-02: 15.04.2022, 21:30 - 23:00

Installation and demonstration of git.

Meeting-03: 19.04.2022, 18:30 - 21:30

Test-02: Bhuvan's test of serial monitor output of potential difference accross a photoresistor.
Test-03: LED pointing the photo resistor with higher energy influx. With additional serial monitor display. Video created.
